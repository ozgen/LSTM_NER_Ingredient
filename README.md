# LSTM_NER_Ingredient

# Ingredient Name Entity Recognition With Bidirectional LSTM Model

First of all, we use keras in order to implemment

 * In order to generate precise dataset for evaluation we developed a website which repository is [here][recipePosMean]
 * Inspiration for this project comes from ny-times working. You can reach from [here][nytimes].
 
 NOTE: Dataset will be added soon. If you want to get dataset asap, you can download [here][dataset]
